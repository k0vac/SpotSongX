# SpotSongX
 **A lightweight Windows Utility for pulling song names from the Spotify app.**
 
SongSpotX is a program aimed for streamers, that captures the main window of the application running on your computer to figure out the song that is being played, and this is written to a separate file to be read by other programs, mainly streaming software (OBS).
